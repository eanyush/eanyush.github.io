              The Arete fellowship is a 8-week program 
          where fellows learn how to maximize their 
          positive impact to tackle the biggest issues 
          humanity faces today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our readings will cover topics ranging from Animal Welfare to AI Safety, and from Extreme Poverty to Global Catastrophic Risks. During the program, fellows will actively lead and engage in intensive discussions revolving around ideas and strategies to mitigate these global issues.
            </p>
            <p> 
              As an Arete Fellow, you will join a global community of scholars from Oxford, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Brown, and many renowned institutions around the world for networking, research, and entrepreneurship opportunities.

        <p> Some efforts to improve the world can be much more impactful than others. Smallpox eradication, the abolitionist movement, germ theory, and the Green Revolution demonstrate what's possible when people come together to solve pressing problems. </p>
        <p>But these exceptional opportunities to do good are few and far between. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-intentioned initiatives are ineffective or even counterproductive. Doing good better is one of the defining challenges of our time. Recognizing this need, we established the Arete Fellowship to equip students with the knowledge to do good in the world more effectively, and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions.</p> 
        <p>By the end of the term, fellows have the knowledge of a few key large-scale and neglected global problems, tools for prioritizing among them, and practical interventions for solving them. Fellows also have access to in-depth career advice and connections. We look forward to learning with you.

        <ul><li>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmSe9xC5N2w">talk</a></li>

        <p>The fellowship is open to all, whether you're an undergraduate, postgraduate or a faculty member of NYU Shanghai. We are committed to building a diverse cohort of fellows.
